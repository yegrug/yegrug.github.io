# Edmonton R User Group - YEGRUG

## Welcome R lovers far and wide! 

We're an online and in-person _R-enthusiast group_ hosting live speaking events on a range of topics, from data wrangling to visualization and Shiny. 

You can join us _in person_ if possible or on one of our _live streams_ to learn R, hone your skills, network, or just to stay up-to-date. All skill levels are welcome.

We are planning to host monthly meetups starting in September, 2021.

***If you would like to present in one of our upcoming meetups, please get in touch with the organizers (@psolymos)***
