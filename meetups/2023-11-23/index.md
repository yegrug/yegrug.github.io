---

In the realm of data science and engineering, the quest for efficiency, performance, and scalability is never-ending. Join us for an enlightening journey into the symbiotic relationship between R and Rust, two seemingly disparate languages that harmonize to empower data scientists and engineers in their quest for excellence.

Our speaker, [Andrés Quintero](https://github.com/andyquinterom), introduced us to **R+Rust**. Andrés, an enthusiastic software engineer hailing from Colombia, boasts over 5 years of dedicated experience in the realm of data. Presently, he's a key member of the team at [Ixpantia](https://www.ixpantia.com/en/) and his mission revolves around optimizing data science and engineering practices for greater efficiency, speed, and simplicity. With an unwavering belief in the transformative potential of Rust, Andrés envisions a world where this versatile language opens up new horizons for data teams worldwide.

Some of the topics he talked about:

1. How R and Rust complement each other
2. Building high performance R packages with Rust
3. R and Rust in microservice architectures
