title: "April 28: eCharts4r for Interactive Visualization with Michael Thomas"
---

Since the implementation of the grammar of graphics in the ggplot2 R package, R became the standard for scientific data visualization. But what if I told you that even ggplot graphics can be improved by making the charts interactive and turbocharged with animations as part of the data story telling?

This is where R meets JavaScript. [ECharts](https://echarts.apache.org/) is one of the most versatile and liked visualization libraries. And of course, there is a package out there, called [echarts4r](https://echarts4r.john-coene.com/), to make ECharts right from R.

At our April Meetup, [**Michael Thomas**](https://twitter.com/mike_ketchbrook) introduce us to echarts4r.
Michael Thomas is the Chief Data Scientist at [Ketchbrook Analytics](https://www.ketchbrookanalytics.com/), a data science consultancy based in Hartford, CT, that specializes in R and Shiny development. He enjoys taking the time to find the right solution for the problem, and has a passion for teaching others about healthy software development practices. Michael gets just as excited crafting machine learning models as he does building web applications, and he is a frequent speaker at events and conferences in the data science space.
