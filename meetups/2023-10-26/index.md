title: "October 26, 2023: Agent based simulations in R with Peter Solymos"
---

Peter Solymos shared some thoughts about agent based simulations in R. We talked statistics, parameter estimation, and how realistic or unrealistic our assumptions might be about the model and how we might confront the models with reality.
