title: "November 25: Model fitting in the cloud with Mauricio Vargas"
---

We welcomed Mauricio "Pach√°" Vargas to our Meetup in November 2021. He presented a talk entitled "_analogsea: Using Arrow, S3 and DigitalOcean for efficient model fitting in the cloud_".

Mauricio is a statistician from Chile, now doing his PhD in Toronto. He has worked on many R packages, interested in international trade and migration related statistical modeling. Mauricio is also a member of the rOpenSci Community and a certified Tidyverse and Shiny RStudio instructor and an active member of the Latin R community (helped to translate the R4DS book to Spanish).
