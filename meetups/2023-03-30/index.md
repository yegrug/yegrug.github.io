title: "March 30, 2023: Linear regression in R with the lm function with Peter Solymos"

We looked at R's most basic statistical functions and learned about linear regression a.k.a. the `lm()` function.

Topics that we covered:

- the meaning of the coefficients and other summaries
- confidence intervals vs. prediction intervals
- overfitting and variable selection
- bias-variance trade-off
- regression trees, boosting, bagging
- LASSO, GAM
