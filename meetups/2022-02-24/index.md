title: "February 24, 2022: YEGRUG and CalgaryR joint meetup and social"
---

We hosted our 1st ever joint social event with the Edmonton and Calgary R User Groups (YEGRUG and CalgaryR). We had two talks, both from the organizers of the Edmonton and Calgary groups.

**Peter Solymos (YEGRUG)** talked about ["_Hosting Data Apps_"](https://hosting.analythium.io/), a website mostly about [Shiny](https://shiny.rstudio.com) app hosting. Peter shared his experiences of Shiny and how the website got started.

**Pablo Adames (CalgaryR)** has been finalizing his _BasicR Syntax Workshop series_, and shared how he designed lessons with the [learnr](https://www.rstudio.com/blog/introducing-learnr/) package, creating R tutorials in RStudio and using Shinyapps.io to deploy them.

Delivering R effectively is a hard problem, even for professionals. The Carpentries recommend RStudio Cloud, using learn on Rstudio + Shinyapps.io is an alternative that has worked as well. See <https://carpentries.org/blog/2020/04/scaffolds/>
