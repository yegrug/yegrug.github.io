## Tips and tricks

- Best way to learn R is through projects: learn troubleshooting early, you will run into issues for sure
- R consultants starting out need to put the word out there so that your network is aware, it is all word of mouth
- Time crunched professional can find time to learn R bit by bit by:
  - communicating this with their higher ups: there are long term returns (time saved)
  - chunking the problems, attach a small piece at once
- Rmarkdown is often the best way to learn R and documenting the learning along the way for future you
- Spin is lesser known way to document your scripts, it is kind of the inverse of Rmarkdown
- Tidyverse for beginners: it is safe, just call things by name, not by their position (that will change)
