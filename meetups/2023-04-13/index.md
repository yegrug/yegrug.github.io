title: "April 13, 2023: Data cloning workshop with Subhash Lele & Peter Solymos"
---

Mixed models, also known as hierarchical models and multilevel models, is a useful class of models for applied sciences. The goal of this workshop is to give an introduction to the logic, theory, and implementation of these models to solve practical problems. The workshop included a seminar style overview and hands on exercises including common model classes and examples that participants can extend for their own needs.

This 4-hour workshop was led by:

- [Subhash Lele](https://scholar.google.ca/citations?hl=en&user=1CNJm5UAAAAJ­), Professor Emeritus, Dept. of Mathematical and Statistical Sciences, U. of Alberta
- [Peter Solymos](https://peter.solymos.org/­), Senior Data Scientist, Organizer of Edmonton R User Group, R package author
