title: "June 23, 2022: Displaying raster files in R with Leaflet with Peter Solymos"
---

Peter talked about the the Leaflet JavaScript library and the similarly named R package, and how to display raster (uniform gridded, "pixel") data sets.

In this talk Peter covered the raster, terra, and stars R packages to work with raster data. He reviewed how to create tiled PNG files using the tiler package, and how to save and display (cloud optimized) GeoTIFF files with overviews using the leafem R package.
