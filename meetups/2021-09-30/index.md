In the second half of the meeting, we'll have the incredible Bruno Tremblay will be giving a talk: "And now your R code has to be reliable (R in Production)". Bruno has a wealth of experience to share in his talk and the Q&A about strategy, checklist, how to make maintenance easier for yourself and others.
