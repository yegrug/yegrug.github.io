title: "May 22, 2023: Futureverse - A unifying parallelization framework in R for everyone with Henrik Bengtsson"
---

At our May 2023 meetup, Henrik Bengtsson, author of the future R package talked about the [futureverse](https://futureverse.org). How the future package came to be, what problems it solves, and what the future of the future looks like.

The future framework makes it easy to parallelize existing R code - often with only a minor change of code. The goal is to lower the barriers so that anyone can safely speed up their existing R code in a worry-free manner.
